The architecture of the above app consists of the following components:

Frontend:

The frontend is built using React Native, a popular JavaScript framework for building mobile applications.
The frontend code is responsible for rendering the user interface and handling user interactions.
It communicates with the backend API to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the todo list.

Backend:

The backend is implemented as an AWS Lambda function using Python.
It serves as the API endpoint for the frontend to interact with the database.
The Lambda function is responsible for handling HTTP requests, processing data, and executing database operations.

Database:

The app uses a PostgreSQL database to store the todo list items.
The database stores the todo items with their respective titles and completion status.

API Gateway:

API Gateway is an AWS service that acts as a front door for the backend API.
It provides a secure and scalable way to expose the Lambda function as a RESTful API.
API Gateway handles the incoming requests from the frontend and forwards them to the Lambda function for processing.

AWS Secrets Manager:

AWS Secrets Manager is used to securely store sensitive information, such as the database credentials.
The Lambda function retrieves the database credentials from Secrets Manager to establish a connection with
the PostgreSQL database.

Communication Flow:

The React Native frontend makes HTTP requests to the API Gateway, sending requests for fetching, 
adding, updating, or deleting todo items.
The API Gateway forwards these requests to the Lambda function.
The Lambda function processes the requests, executes the corresponding database operations using the 
psycopg2 library, and returns the response to the API Gateway.
The API Gateway then sends the response back to the frontend.

Overall, the architecture follows a serverless approach using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to handle the backend 
logic and API communication, while the React Native frontend interacts with the API to provide a user-friendly 
interface for managing the todo list. The PostgreSQL database stores and retrieves the todo items.
